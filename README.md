Clojure code inspired by The Nature of Computation by Cristopher Moore &amp; Stephan Mertens

If you are still unaware, [The Nature of Computation](http://nature-of-computation.org/) - hereby abbreviated TNOC - 
is an amazing book about computer science that deserves to be counted among other enduring works such as Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs or The Art of Computer Programming. This project is a collection of code that 
touches upon the topics laid out in TNOC. None of this is intended for production, but rather for exploration and experimentation.

See the project wiki for further documentation.
